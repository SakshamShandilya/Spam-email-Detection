# Spam Email Detection Project

This project is aimed at developing a spam email detection system using Python. The implementation utilizes various modules and tools to create a user-friendly web application for detecting spam emails. Below are the key modules used in this project:

## Modules Used

### 1. Streamlit

[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) is an open-source Python library designed to simplify the process of creating interactive web applications for machine learning and data science. It allows for the easy creation and sharing of customizable web apps.

### 2. Pickle

[Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) is a module in Python used for serializing and deserializing Python object structures. It converts Python objects into a byte stream, enabling storage in files/databases, maintaining program state across sessions, or transporting data over the network.

### 3. String

The [string module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html) in Python contains various string-related utilities. In this project, the `capwords` function from the string module is used. This function splits the specified string into words and capitalizes each word.

### 4. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) is a Python package for natural language processing (NLP). It provides tools for working with human-readable text, making it suitable for processing unstructured data. The project uses NLTK for text preprocessing tasks.

## How to Run the Program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This command will launch the web application, allowing you to interact with the spam email detection system.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: Main script for the Streamlit web application.
- **model.pkl**: Pickle file containing the trained machine learning model for spam detection.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required for running the project.

## Project Workflow

1. The Streamlit web application provides a user interface for interacting with the spam email detection system.
2. The application uses the Pickle module to load a pre-trained machine learning model (`model.pkl`).
3. The NLTK module is employed for natural language processing tasks, aiding in the preprocessing of email content.
4. The String module's `capwords` function is utilized for string manipulation as part of the preprocessing.
5. The trained model evaluates the input email and determines whether it is spam or not.
6. The result is presented to the user through the Streamlit web interface.
